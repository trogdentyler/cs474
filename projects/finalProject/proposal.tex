\maketitle

    Prompt: \textbf{Write a proposal for your final project.} Submit a PDF proposal of your project idea, no more that 1 page in length (12pt times roman font, 1 inch margins, single-spaced). This should clearly define your goal, your approach, measures of success, and available resources. This will take some thinking, some looking ahead, some research, some creativity. It should be well-written and as concrete as possible (this doesn't mean things can't change, but the more planning you do now, the better experience you will have with this project).

    The goal of this project is to replicate the results of the paper "Controlling Perceptual Factors
    in Neural Style Transfer" by Gatys et al.  In the paper, the authors use a technique called "neural style transfer" 
    to transfer the style of one image onto the content of another image, which we previously discussed in class
    and implemented in the homework. The authors of the paper then go on to show that they can extend this technique
    to control the perceptual factors of the resulting image, such as the color, location, and spatial scale.
